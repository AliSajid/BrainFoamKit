# The Brainf**k Language Reference

## Background

Brainf**k is an esoteric and minimalist programming language. This language has entertained and puzzled programmers since its inception.
The programming language uses only 8 symbols, with 7 primitive operations and works on a memory array. Despite this simplicity,
it happens to be [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness).

This chapter provides an overview of the language, as it was specified by Urban Müller in 1993.
